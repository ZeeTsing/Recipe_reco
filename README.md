# Food.com: Topic modelling and personalized recommendation

There are two parts of this project:
* discover topics in recipes using topic modelling
* create recipe recommendation

We chose LDA to implement topic modelling while recipe recommendation was achieved by collaborative filtering, exploring user based, content based and hybrid models.
