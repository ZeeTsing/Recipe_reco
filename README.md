# Food.com: Topic modelling and personalized recommendation

There are two parts of this project:
* discover topics in recipes using topic modelling
* create recipe recommendation

We chose LDA to implement topic modelling while recipe recommendation was achieved by collaborative filtering, exploring user based, content based and hybrid models.

I have written two blogs on this project, first blog talks about LDA on its own. [Click here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/discover-recipe-topics-using-topic-modeling-with-lda-44ba1f88c668) for the first blog.
The second blog talks about recommender system from a beginner's perspective.
